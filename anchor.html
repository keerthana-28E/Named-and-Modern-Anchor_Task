    <p style="font-size: larger;">Wings of Fire (1999), is the autobiography of the Missile Man of India and President
        of India, Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam. It was written by him and Arun Tiwari.[1]

        In the autobiography, Kalam examines his early life, effort, hardship, fortitude, luck and chance that
        eventually led him to lead Indian space research, nuclear and missile programs. Kalam started his career, after
        graduating from Aerospace engineering at Madras Institute of Technology, at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and
        was assigned to build a hovercraft prototype. Later he moved to ISRO and helped establish the Vikram Sarabhai
        Space Centre and pioneered the first space launch-vehicle program. During the 1990s and early 2000, Kalam moved
        to the DRDO to lead the Indian nuclear weapons program, with particular successes in thermonuclear weapons
        development culminating in the operation Smiling Buddha and an ICBM Agni.</p>

    <h3 style="font-style:bold;" id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">Kalam was born on October 15, 1931, the son of a little educated boat owner in
        Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. His father was also imam of the small mosque in Rameswaram. He had an unparalleled
        career as a defence scientist, culminating in the highest civilian award of India, Bharat Ratna. As chief of the
        country's defence research and development programmer, Kalam demonstrated a great, great potential for dynamics
        and innovations that existed in a seemingly moribund research establishment. This is the story of Kalam's own
        rise from obscurity and his personal and professional struggles, as well as the story of AGNI, TRISHUL, and NAG
        missiles that have become household names in India and that have raised the nation to the level of a missile
        power of international reckoning. Since independence, India has sought in various ways, self-realization,
        adulation, and success.

    <h3 style="font-style:bold;" id="Orientation">Orientation</h3>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">The book begins with the childhood of Kalam's life. In the beginning, he introduces us
        to his family and tries to familiarize us with his birthplace Rameswaram. In the childhood, he was a great
        admirer of his father, Jainulabdeen. He was a man of great wisdom and kindness, and Pakshi Lakshmana Sastry, a
        close friend of his father and the head priest of the Rameswaram Temple. He had an ideal helpmate in his mother,
        Ashiamma. He was also influenced by his close friend, Ahmed Jalaluddin; he was about 15 years older than Kalam.
        With his friend, he talked about spiritual matters. This shows that he believed in spirituality and also
        believed in God or Khuda. He always went to Lord Shiva's temple with his friends.In the later part of the
        opening chapters, he introduces his cousin Samsuddin, his school teachers, and all the people who have felt any
        difference amongst them. Here he expresses one event, which happened in his school days, "Rameswaram Sastry, a
        new teacher of his school, could not stomach a Hindu Priest's son sitting with a Muslim boy. In accordance with
        our social ranking as the new teacher saw it, I was asked to go and sit on the backbench. I felt very sad, and
        so did my parents about the incident. Lakshmana Sastry summoned the teacher, and in our presence, told the
        teacher that he should not spread the poison of social inequality and communal intolerance in the minds of
        innocent children".He completed his school education in the Rameswaram Elementary School in Rameswaram and later
        on studied at Schwartz high school in Ramanathapuram. In 1950, he joined St. Joseph's College Trichi, to study
        for the B.Sc degree course when he realized that physics was not his subject. Then, at last, he applied to
        Madras Institute of Technology. He or his family could not afford to spend that much money on the course at
        Madras Institute of Technology. Zohara, his sister stood with him. When he had a specific branch of aeronautical
        engineering, the goal was very clear in his mind at that time. And he tried to communicate with different kinds
        of people. At Madras Institute of Technology, their teachers shaped his thoughts, Prof. Sponder, Prof. Kal
        Pandalai, and Prof. Narasingalu Rao. Each of them had carried distinct personalities. Last year Madras Institute
        of Technology was a year of transition and had a great impact on his later life. From Madras Institute of
        Technology, he went out to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, [HAL], at Bangalore as a trainer. There he worked on
        engine overhauling as part of a team. He had trained in radial engine-cum- drum operations. After the completion
        of engineering, he had applied for the Air Force and Directorate of Technical Development and Production –DTP
        and PC (Air) of the Ministry of Defence. But he was not selected in Air Force because he failed to pass the
        physical fitness standards. Later, he was appointed in DTP and PC (Air) as senior scientific Assistant on a
        basic salary only of Rs. 250 per month, in 1950. He had to create opportunities on his own. At this stage, he
        covered 32 eventful years of his life when he was just on the threshold of his career after graduation.

    <h3 style="font-style:bold;" id="Creation">Creation</h3>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">The section 'Creation' traverses seven chapters, from chapters four to chapter ten;
        and covers Kalam's life and work for 17 years, from the year 1963 until 1980. It begins with his recollection of
        works at the Langley Research Center, NASA, in Houston, Virginia, U.S., and at other facilities in the US,
        including the Wallops Flight Facility at Wallops Island in East Coast of the United States, Virginia. At a NASA
        facility, he remembers to have seen a painting, prominently displayed in the lobby. The painting depicted a
        battle scene with a rocket flying in the background. On closer examination, he found that the painting depicted
        Tipu Sultan's army fighting the British. Kalam felt happy to see an Indian glorified in NASA as a hero of
        rocketry warfare.

        His association with the Satellite Launch Vehicle and related projects are vividly presented in the section
        'Creation'. During the period covered under 'Creation', Kalam, in the year 1976, lost his father who lived up to
        102 years of age. Kalam took the bereavement with courage and remembered these words written on the death of
        William Butler Yeats by his friend Auden, and his father:

        Earth receive an honoured guest;
        William Yeats is laid to rest:
        In the prison of his days
        Teach the free man how to praise.
        A pleasant surprise came in the form of conferment of Padma Bhushan on Republic Day, 1981.
        Creation

        Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) became his first employers after completing his education
        as he was given a project on hovercrafts.

        After nearly four years with DRDO, he joined the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) where he was mentored
        by some of the brightest Indian minds of Science like Professor Vikram Sarabhai, Dr Werner Van Braun, and
        Professor Satish Dhawan etc.

        He would go on to be part of several important satellite launches during his stint with DRDO with the crowning
        jewel being the Project Director of SLV-III, India’s first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle (1980).


        Here, Kalam has incorporated minutest of scientific acronyms, details etc. and tried to establish a window into
        his world of science and innovation. Another noticeable thing is his interactions with the common folks in such
        an organization and outside.

    <p style="font-size: larger;">
        Section Propitiation covers the period 1981 to 1991. This section covers the scientist's journey towards
        becoming the "missile man of India". In this section, his excellent leadership qualities as taking up the
        responsibility of shaping up the Guided Missile Development Program, are clearly visible. In this phase of the
        life, Kalam was responsible for the development of the 5 missiles – Prithvi, Trishul, Akash, Nag and Agni.
        In 1982, Kalam changes his place of work to rejoin the defence labs at the DRDO as its Director. Kalam goes on
        to give a firsthand account of some of the most incredible scientific innovations of the country like Polar
        Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), the Integrated Guided Missile Programme of India and its constituent missiles
        like Akaash, Naga, Trishul and especially Agni, the Indian Intercontinental Ballistic Missile series.

        He even produced healthcare products using the same missile technology. He earned his moniker of ‘Missile-man of
        India’ for his achievement in this phase of his life. His insistence on a participative model of management was
        based on bringing the best out of every person. It made him a scientist with a soul.
        The section also pays tribute to the greatest scientific minds in the Indian Space journey and has a celebratory
        and nostalgic feel to it. Also, we again get to see his real-life work through many black and white snapshots

    <a href="#NEXT">NEXT</a>
    <h3 style="font-style: bold;"><a name="Summary">Summary</a></h3>
    <p style="font-size: larger;">
        The first part is all about the life of young Kalam. There is a mix of his interactions with his family, friends
        and teachers. The lessons he learned in through his tutelage and upbringing in Rameshwaram are beautifully
        dotted with black and white photographs of the period.


        It also covers his early education leading up to his graduation in aeronautical engineering degree from the
        Madras Institute of Technology.

        He hailed from a working-class Tamil Muslim family and the book is an interesting peek into the harmonious
        commingling of Hindus and Muslims of India celebrating the multi-ethnic, multi-religious and composite wealth
        India.


        As a boy, he sold newspapers to help his brother and to overcome his own financial challenges while attaining
        his education. Through the text, the need and support of family and friends are eulogized and it certainly
        proved to be the cornerstone of his life’s successes.


        Contemplation
        The last part starts with him becoming the Scientific Advisor to India’s Defense Minister in 1992. In this phase
        of life, he contributed heavily to the nation becoming a nuclear power and reaching its nuclear destiny with the
        successful nuclear tests at Pokhran, Rajasthan in 1998.

        As ex-officio chairman of the Scientific Advisory Committee to the Cabinet (SAC-C), he went to chart out a
        vision of India 2020 as the World welcomed the new millennium.
        Never a man for the [plaudits, Kalam would go on to be bestowed with the country’s top three civilian awards:
        Bharat Ratna (1997), Padma Vibhushan (1990) and Padma Bhushan (1981 ). Overall, he boasted an astounding haul of
        honorary degrees from 30+ universities from across the planet.

        The section also notes ideas, his contemplations and advice for the future of India culminating into Kalam’s
        -Vision 2020. A flag post of India attaining of self-sufficiency in innovation & technology vision. A perfect
        epilogue to an inspirational life journey.


        Conclusion
        A common man’s journey to the orbit of success and commendation, the autobiography is widely considered one of
        the most inspiring of its time.

        It is an extraordinary story of a seemingly ordinary man with extraordinary drive and talents. It narrates the
        scientific voyage of a pioneer and far-sighted leader whose actions louder than his speeches and whose conduct
        disarmed his harshest of critics if there were any.

        In a country and a time ravaged by communal fire (Babri Masjid Demotion of 1992 by Terrorists) and in
        bureaucratic system paralyzed with greed and corruption, Abdul Kalam gave up his personal life for a life in
        service to his country and his countrymen so much so that he died on the stage giving a lecture.
